# Evolution of Todo (Hackathon II) Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
The /specs folder is the absolute source of truth for all project requirements and implementations. All features and functionality must be defined in specifications before any code is written. Specifications drive implementation decisions and serve as the authoritative reference for all development activities.

### II. AI-Native Implementation
All code must be generated by Claude Code; no manual coding is permitted. This ensures consistent quality, adherence to best practices, and reproducible development processes. Any code not generated by Claude Code must be removed and regenerated to maintain compliance.

### III. Iterative Evolution
Build phase-by-phase following the sequence: Console → Web → Chatbot → K8s → Cloud. Each phase must be completed and validated before proceeding to the next phase. This ensures steady, controlled progression toward the final product while maintaining working software at each stage.

### IV. Standardized Technology Stack
Use standardized technology stack: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI ChatKit for frontend; Python 3.13+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless Postgres for backend; OpenAI Agents SDK, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI layer; Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube/DOKS), Helm, Dapr, Kafka for infrastructure. This ensures consistency, maintainability, and team familiarity with tools.

### V. Strict Monorepo Structure
Maintain strict monorepo structure with /frontend, /backend, and /specs directories. All secrets must use environment variables. Refine specs to fix bugs; do not patch code manually. This ensures organized project structure and secure handling of sensitive information.

### VI. Continuous Integration and Deployment
Implement automated CI/CD pipelines with comprehensive testing at each stage. All changes must pass automated tests before merging. Deployments must be automated, repeatable, and rollback-capable. This ensures high-quality, reliable software delivery.

## Technology Standards
Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI ChatKit. Backend: Python 3.13+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless Postgres. AI Layer: OpenAI Agents SDK, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tools. Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube/DOKS), Helm, Dapr, Kafka. All technologies must be current and actively maintained with strong community support.

## Project Constraints
Strict monorepo structure: /frontend, /backend, and /specs. All secrets must use environment variables. Refine specs to fix bugs; do not patch code manually. All code must be AI-generated. Phased development approach must be followed. Dependencies must be kept minimal and justified.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards. All amendments must be documented and approved through the established process. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Code generation must be attributed to Claude Code. Deviations require explicit approval and justification.
