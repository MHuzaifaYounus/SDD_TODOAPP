# Research Notes: Todo AI Chatbot Basic Level Functionality

## Resolved Clarifications

No explicit "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers were identified in the Technical Context section of the implementation plan. All technology choices and architectural approaches were sufficiently clear based on the feature specification.

## Implicit Research Areas (for best practices)

While no specific clarifications were needed, the following areas will require implicit research during implementation to ensure best practices and optimal integration:

-   FastAPI application structure and project organization.
-   SQLModel integration with FastAPI for efficient database interactions.
-   OpenAI Agents SDK integration patterns with custom tool definitions.
-   MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation guidelines and best practices.
-   OpenAI ChatKit frontend integration with a Python FastAPI backend, including API communication and state management.
-   Leveraging Neon Serverless PostgreSQL features effectively within a FastAPI application.
