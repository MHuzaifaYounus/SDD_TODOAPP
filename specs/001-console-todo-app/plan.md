# Implementation Plan: Console Todo App

**Branch**: `001-console-todo-app` | **Date**: 2026-01-10 | **Spec**: [specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md](../001-console-todo-app/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of an in-memory Python console application for managing todo tasks. The application will provide a CLI menu interface allowing users to perform CRUD operations on tasks (Add, List, Update, Delete, Toggle Status). The app will run in a continuous loop until the user chooses to exit, with all data stored in-memory using Python data structures.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: uv (dependency/project management)
**Storage**: In-memory data structure (List of Dictionaries/Objects) - No database
**Testing**: pytest (for unit and integration tests)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: Single project (console application)
**Performance Goals**: Fast response times for CLI operations, <100ms per operation
**Constraints**: Handle invalid inputs gracefully without crashing, distinguish completed/pending tasks with [x]/[ ] formatting
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user console application, designed for personal task management

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Spec-Driven Development**: Implementation will strictly follow the feature specification in spec.md
- **AI-Native Implementation**: All code will be generated by Claude Code as required by constitution
- **Iterative Evolution**: This is Phase I (Console) of the evolution roadmap (Console → Web → Chatbot → K8s → Cloud)
- **Standardized Technology Stack**: Using Python 3.13+ as specified in constitution
- **Strict Monorepo Structure**: Following the monorepo approach with proper directory structure

```

**Structure Decision**: Selected Option 1: Single project structure since this is a console application with a single entry point. The structure includes separate modules for models (task data structure), services (business logic), CLI (user interface), and utilities.
