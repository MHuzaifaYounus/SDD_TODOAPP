# Research for Phase II Full-Stack Web Application

## Unresolved Clarifications from `spec.md`

### 1. Core Application Functionality

-   **Decision**: NEEDS USER CLARIFICATION
-   **Rationale**: What is the main purpose or domain of this web application? What specific user needs or business problems does it aim to solve? (e.g., a To-Do app, an e-commerce platform, a blog, a data dashboard, etc.)
-   **Alternatives considered**: To-Do app, e-commerce platform, blog, data dashboard, other domain-specific applications.

### 2. Initial Data Model

-   **Decision**: NEEDS USER CLARIFICATION
-   **Rationale**: Based on the core functionality, what are the primary data entities and their relationships that need to be modeled with SQLModel and stored in Neon DB? (e.g., for a To-Do app: `Task` with `title`, `description`, `status`, `due_date`).
-   **Alternatives considered**: Defining entities for a To-Do app (Task), e-commerce (Product, User, Order), blog (Post, Comment, User), etc.

### 3. Authentication/Authorization Requirements

-   **Decision**: NEEDS USER CLARIFICATION
-   **Rationale**: Will the application require user authentication and/or authorization? If so, what level of security is needed (e.g., simple login, OAuth2, role-based access control)?
-   **Alternatives considered**: No authentication, simple login/registration, OAuth2 with social providers, role-based access control (RBAC).

## Technical Research

Given the current `spec.md`, no specific technical research beyond the project setup is immediately required. Future technical research will depend on the clarifications provided for the above questions.
