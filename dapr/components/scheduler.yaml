# Dapr Cron Binding Component Configuration (for Jobs API)
# This component uses the cron binding to define scheduled tasks.
# The actual "Jobs API" in Dapr v1.11+ doesn't require a separate component to *enable* the API,
# but rather relies on a binding for scheduling. This 'bindings.cron' can trigger events
# or calls based on a cron schedule.
