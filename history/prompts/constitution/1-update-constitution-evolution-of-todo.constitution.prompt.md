## Prompt

Project: Evolution of Todo (Hackathon II)
Core principles:
- Spec-Driven Development: The /specs folder is the absolute source of truth.
- AI-Native Implementation: All code must be generated by Claude Code; no manual coding.
- Iterative Evolution: Build phase-by-phase (Console → Web → Chatbot → K8s → Cloud).
Key standards:
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI ChatKit.
- Backend: Python 3.13+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless Postgres.
- AI Layer: OpenAI Agents SDK, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tools.
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube/DOKS), Helm, Dapr, Kafka.
Constraints:
- Strict Monorepo structure: /frontend, /backend, and /specs.
- All secrets must use environment variables.
- Refine specs to fix bugs; do not patch code manually.

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution with the specified principles for the Evolution of Todo (Hackathon II) project. Created a new constitution document with six core principles: I. Spec-Driven Development, II. AI-Native Implementation, III. Iterative Evolution, IV. Standardized Technology Stack, V. Strict Monorepo Structure, and VI. Continuous Integration and Deployment. Also included sections for Technology Standards, Project Constraints, and Governance.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new constitution file with all specified principles
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for this task
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with project implementation based on new constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now serves as the authoritative guide for the project with clear principles and constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing the first phase of the project according to the constitution
