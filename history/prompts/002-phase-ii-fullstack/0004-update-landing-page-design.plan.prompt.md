## Prompt

/sp.plan Update the landing page design like a proper startup like landing page to impress the users for using the todo app

## Response snapshot

I have completed the planning phase for the landing page design update. I have updated the `plan.md` with the technical context, constitution check, project structure, and complexity tracking. I have also created `research.md` with research tasks, `data-model.md` and `contracts/README.md` to indicate no changes, `quickstart.md` with instructions to run the application, and updated the agent context.

The following artifacts were generated:
- **Branch**: `001-web-app`
- **IMPL_PLAN path**: `/mnt/d/Agentic AI/TodoApp/specs/001-web-app/plan.md`
- **Generated artifacts**:
    - `/mnt/d/Agentic AI/TodoApp/specs/001-web-app/plan.md` (modified)
    - `/mnt/d/Agentic AI/TodoApp/specs/001-web-app/research.md` (created)
    - `/mnt/d/Agentic AI/TodoApp/specs/001-web-app/data-model.md` (created)
    - `/mnt/d/Agentic AI/TodoApp/specs/001-web-app/contracts/README.md` (created)
    - `/mnt/d/Agentic AI/TodoApp/specs/001-web-app/quickstart.md` (created)
    - `/mnt/d/Agentic AI/TodoApp/GEMINI.md` (modified)

I am now ready for the next command.
