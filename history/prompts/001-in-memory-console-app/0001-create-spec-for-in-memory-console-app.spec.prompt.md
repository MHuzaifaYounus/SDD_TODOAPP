## Prompt

write specify file for Phase I in the specs folder In-Memory Python Console App Python, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus don't change anything else

## Response snapshot

Created a new feature branch `001-in-memory-console-app`, generated a detailed specification in `specs/001-in-memory-console-app/spec.md`, and created a validation checklist. The feature is ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a complete and validated feature specification, enabling the next phase of development.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a specification-writing task.
- 📁 Files: Created 2 files: the specification and the quality checklist.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of deriving a structured spec from a noisy prompt was successful. The initial "in-memory console app" interpretation was correct.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
